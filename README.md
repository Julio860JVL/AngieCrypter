# AngieCrypter
With the unexpected arrival and overwhelming amount of people talking about the new AI technology, I decided to put it to the test with a very basic crypter that I could create in a few hours.

I am very well aware of how capable AI could be and how much capable it will become. This is why I was a little worried when I was wondering if this AI could actually decypher/break a very basic English characters swap algorithm.

I was very surprise to see that it actually tried to break the code but it was not even close.

However I don't think it will fail for long. When it becomes far superior than what it is already, I truly believe that, it is not a matter of if, but when it will be able to decypher/break this basic characters swap encryption.
